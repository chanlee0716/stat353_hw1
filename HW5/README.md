## Overview

The final exam this year is based upon last year's statistics qualifying exam data and questions. You will have a week to work on this exam --- whereas those taking the qualifying exam last year had 3 days. For those of you in the Statistics PhD or MS programs, this should give you a good blueprint of what to expect on the qualifying exam. 

As you go about working on this exam, take a step back and reflect on what you have learned this quarter. You certainly don't need to use everything you've learned, but you do need to choose carefully which tools and models are appropriate to the problem at hand. Pay particular attention to how you explain what you've done and how others should interpret your findings --- including any caveats or assumptions. 

## Submission Instructions

Students will submit a rendered html file which **must contain a link to your GitHub repo**. Including the GitHub repo link provides all the support materials needed to reproduce your work, an essential feature of quality scientific work. Please name the html file `Lastname_Firstname_final_exam.html`
